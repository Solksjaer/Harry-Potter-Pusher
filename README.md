# Harry Potter Pusher

## What's this about?

Hey developers! This ia a full stack real time Harry Potter house voting web application. It has a real time stats graph, which means, you don't need to refresh the browser to look at the state of the application, see the votes or the results as they come in.

This is for an article I am writing for Pusher, titled **Realtime voting application using Pusher with Node JS**. You can read about it [here](https://pusher.com/tutorials).

## Pre-Requisites

Since this is a Node JS application, you require very minimal stuff.

1. Operating System that supports Node JS.
2. Node JS
3. Pusher Account (create one free [here](https://pusher.com/))
4. Decent Web Browser that supports Web Sockets
5. Passion to learn and implement Stuff

## Installation

Very simple. Once you have got all the pre-requisites ready, just clone the repository, and run:

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm start

# Or for the dev mode
$ npm run dev
```

The server will be running. Open http://localhost:3000/ in your favourite browser.
